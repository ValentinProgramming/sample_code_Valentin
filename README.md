# sample_code_Valentin

Here is a small piece of code used in the tool I implemented and am still working on.

The code will execute by running "node .\scraperSample.js".

You can modify line 273 (countriesLocations variable) and line 275 (careerbuilder.main method call) to change the data retrieved (and make the code execution shorter for instance).

Once the data collection process is done, json files will be created displaying the gotten data.

Comments written in uppercase are here to add precision to the minimized version extracted for the test purpose. 
Comments written in uppercase surrounded by brackets are places where code has been deleted in comparison with the actual tool.
